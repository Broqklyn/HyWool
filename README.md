# HyWool
HyWool is a discord bot to check your wool wars stats from Hypixel!

HyWool started off as a side project for me and a few friends in the wool wars community to check there stats and to obtain more accurate updated statistics of others. 

This bot later on turned to a public project and is now used by over 100+ servers! All code with in the bot is created with in python and meant for educational purposes with in this repository! 

The commands with in the bot at the moment are:

- !hywool 
- !wwp <player> 
- !wwlb <player>
- !wwa <player>
- !wwcs <player> 
- !wwinv 
- !wwpar 
- !wwlbs 
- !wwcalc <int>
- !wwpid <uuid of player> 
- !wwlfp <party size>
- !id <player>
  
We also have a module dedicated to in-game via the ChatTriggers mod from the ChatTriggers team allowing me to upload a module for a complete remake so far of HyWool in-game but a bit better considering how you can check stats in-game and a lot more to come in the future! 

This is a beta project along side of the HyWool project!

You can fork this project if you want but you should at least let me know you wanna fork it by making a request via the github page!
